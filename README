This folder contains a collection of the Unix Xlock screen saver ports for Win32.

I originally did the work ca. 1995 under MSVC4.  I cannot vouch for the correctness of the code or if they will compile correctly.

Command line options:
 /s - start saver
 /c - start saver in cfg mode


Clean all cruft:
		UNIX: for i in $(echo "Debug Release *.ncb *.opt *.plg *.aps");do find . -iname "$i" -exec rm -rf '{}' ';';done

Enjoy!
